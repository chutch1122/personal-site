    Hey, I’m Cameron!
  </h1>

  <p>
    I’m a software architect with over a decade of experience in full-stack development, cloud infrastructure,
    and—more recently—generative AI. I focus on designing scalable platforms, exploring emerging technologies,
    and turning ambitious ideas into real-world, impactful solutions. I’m at my best when building things that
    push boundaries, solve complex problems, and make life easier for the people who use them.

  <p>
    Outside of work, you’ll find me outdoors, spinning one of my 150+ vinyl records, or cheering on the St. Louis Blues.

  <p>
    This site is a place to share my work, resume, and the occasional post on technology, AI, or whatever I’m exploring
    next.
